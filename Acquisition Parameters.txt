Some observations and possible modifications:

1) The above protocoll consists of 24 single voxel spectrum acquisitions
   with TE's starting at 30ms up to 260ms in steps of 10ms.
   For quantification relative to the unsuppressed water signal a reference spectrum 
   is included for each TE. Total acquisition time is just below 9min  

2) For those who are in hurry the acquisition time can be reduced to 7min
   setting "Startup acquisitions = 0", however this will introduce a slight error 
   due to T1 relaxation, mainly in the first TE. But this is certainly less troublesome than
   reducing the number of TE's, by the contrary, it could be desirable to further increase
   this number to be able to more precisely measure T2 of long decay metabolites such as NAA.

3) If the purpose of the experiment is exclusively to measure T2 relaxation times without the
   need of absolute quantification of metabolite concentrations, then, and only then, the 
   water reference could be disabled by setting "Spectral correction = no" which saves some 
   aditional time.
   In this specific case it also can be helpful to specify non equally spaced TE's
   For example: 30,40,60,100,180,340,660ms
   CAUTION: the MRS_T2fit software currently only can deal with non equally spaced TE's
   when DICOM input files are specified, since the SDAT file only contains the value 
   of the first TE.

4) If scan time is less of an issue it could be interesting to increase TR (e.g. >= 4000ms)
   NSA/#phasecycles (e.g. 16) and eventually also the spectral correction NSA (e.g. 2).
   However all of the above together would result in a scan time of approximately 30min.
